> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will be used to structure the content of the web application, including the layout of pages, forms for user input, and navigation elements.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to style the web application, customizing to the ninja theme.
- **React** - React will be used to build the user interface, allowing for dynamic updates and a responsive experience.
- **Service** - Be the layer between the frontend and the database, handling API requests and user authentication.
- **DB/Login** - Track user data, including login credentials, portfolio information, and transaction history.
- **WebSocket** - Enable real-time updates for stock prices and user portfolio changes. This will allow users to see live data without needing to refresh the page and allowing users to make informed trading decisions quickly.
