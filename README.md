# Naataanii Tsosie - Time Ninja

[My Notes](notes.md)

My application is a time tracking sheet for small business. Why over pay for expensive software when you can have a simple web app that does the same thing for a super low cost!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Time tracking for small businesses should not be complicated. Time Ninja makes it simple to track employee hours so you can focus on your business. With an easy-to-use interface, employees can clock in and out, and managers can review timesheets.

### Design

### Key features

- Real-time clock-in and clock-out for employees
- Manager dashboard for reviewing timesheets
- Exportable reports for payroll processing
- Time history tracking for employees

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML will be used to structure the content of the web application, including the layout of pages, forms for user input, and navigation elements.
- **CSS** - CSS will be used to style the web application, customizing to the ninja theme.
- **React** - React will be used to build the user interface, allowing for dynamic updates and a responsive experience.
- **Service** - Be the layer between the frontend and the database, handling API requests and user authentication.
- **DB/Login** - Track user data, including login credentials, work hours, and work location.
- **WebSocket** - Enable real-time updates to see "who is on the clock". This will allow users to see live data without needing to refresh the page and allowing managers to make informed work decisions quickly.
